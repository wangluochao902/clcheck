e-options option-v:
    -v, --version
        Show the program version.
e-end

e-options option-h:
    -h, --help
        Show a short usage summary.

e-options options:
    -q, --quiet
    e-syntax:-q=<INT>, -q, --quiet=<INT>, --quiet, -qq e-end
    e-spec: (mutex:[--print-uris, -s]) e-end
        Quiet; produces output suitable for logging, omitting progress indicators. More q's will produce more quiet up to a maximum of 2. You can
        also use -q=# to set the quiet level, overriding the configuration file. Note that quiet level 2 implies -y; you should never use -qq
        without a no-action modifier such as -d, --print-uris or -s as APT may decide to do something you did not expect. Configuration Item:
        quiet.

    -s, --simulate, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon, --no-act
        No action; perform a simulation of events that would occur based on the current system state but do not actually change the system. Locking
        will be disabled (Debug::NoLocking) so the system state could change while apt-get is running. Simulations can also be executed by non-root
        users which might not have read access to all apt configuration distorting the simulation. A notice expressing this warning is also shown
        by default for non-root users (APT::Get::Show-User-Simulation-Note). Configuration Item: APT::Get::Simulate.

        Simulated runs print out a series of lines, each representing a dpkg operation: configure (Conf), remove (Remv) or unpack (Inst). Square
        brackets indicate broken packages, and empty square brackets indicate breaks that are of no consequence (rare).

    -y, --yes, --assume-yes
        Automatic yes to prompts; assume "yes" as answer to all prompts and run non-interactively. If an undesirable situation, such as changing a
        held package, trying to install a unauthenticated package or removing an essential package occurs then apt-get will abort. Configuration
        Item: APT::Get::Assume-Yes.

    --assume-no 
    e-spec: (mutex:[-y]) e-end
        Automatic "no" to all prompts. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Assume-No.

    --allow-downgrades
        This is a dangerous option that will cause apt to continue without prompting if it is doing downgrades. It should not be used except in
        very special situations. Using it can potentially destroy your system! Configuration Item: APT::Get::allow-downgrades. Introduced in APT
        1.1.

    --print-uris
        Instead of fetching the files to install their URIs are printed. Each URI will have the path, the destination file name, the size and the
        expected MD5 hash. Note that the file name to write to will not always match the file name on the remote site! This also works with the
        source and update commands. When used with the update command the MD5 and size are not included, and it is up to the user to decompress any
        compressed files. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Print-URIs.

    -o, --option
    e-syntax:-o+=</\S+/>, --option+=</\S+/> e-end
        Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary configuration option. The syntax is -o Foo::Bar=bar.  -o and --option can be used
        multiple times to set different options.

    e-variables:
        e-let m1 = "dangerous option"
        e-let pkg-with-optional-version = {<PKG> ["="<VERSION>]}(NWS)
    e-end
e-end

e-explanation:
    install
        install is followed by one or more packages desired for installation or upgrading. Each package is a package name, not a fully qualified

        A specific version of a package can be selected for installation by following the package name with an equals and the version of the

    remove
        remove is identical to install except that packages are removed instead of installed. Note that removing a package leaves its configuration
        files on the system. If a plus sign is appended to the package name (with no intervening space), the identified package will be installed
        instead of removed.
